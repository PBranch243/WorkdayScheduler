# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
Here is a simple work day scheduler. 

I had trouble pushing it to github before class because it had a git repository inside another repository
I tried to resolve the issue using the suggestions git gave me, but to no avail and decided it may be better to just retype it and try again.

I have tried to comment heavily to show my thought/development process, but at this point I need to get something turned in and perhaps resubmit with improvements
